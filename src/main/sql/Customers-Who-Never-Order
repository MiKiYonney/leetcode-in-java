SELECT c.Name from Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o on  c.Id = o.CustomerId
WHERE o.CustomerId is NULL;

## more efficiency

SELECT c.Name from Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Orders o WHERE c.Id = o.CustomerId);

select c.Name from  Customers c where c.id not in (select o.CustomerId from Orders o );
